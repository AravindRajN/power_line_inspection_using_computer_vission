# Abstract

Power line inspection is a crucial task in the power industry, as it ensures the safe and efficient operation of power transmission systems. However, traditional inspection methods involving human workers to physically climb the power lines pose significant safety risks and are time-consuming. To address these challenges, our company provides a solution for power line inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and computer vision technology. Our system allows for quick and safe inspections, reducing the need for human workers to physically climb the power lines. By using high-resolution cameras and advanced algorithms, our UAVs can detect and identify potential faults or damages, allowing for faster repairs and reducing downtime. Our solution is not only more efficient and cost-effective than traditional inspection methods but also significantly improves safety for workers. In this abstract, we highlight the benefits of our technology for power line inspection and its potential to revolutionize the power industry.
